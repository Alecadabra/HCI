> An introduction to human computer interfaces, including the motivation and
contexts for using these. The class teaches a process for user centred
development as well as different measures for evaluation and models that inform
human computer interface design. Social issues influencing human computer
interface design and use are considered, as well as multi-cultural interaction
and communication in order to accommodate human diversity. The different user
interface standards and principles of graphical user interfaces are covered in
addition to designing and programming GUIs both in native and web formats and
widgets. Geometry management, event management and user interaction are
introduced. Finally, user interface programming environments and future
developments are discussed.

## [Assignment](Assignment)

A JavaFX GUI that I put very little effort into and am not particularly
proud of :).
